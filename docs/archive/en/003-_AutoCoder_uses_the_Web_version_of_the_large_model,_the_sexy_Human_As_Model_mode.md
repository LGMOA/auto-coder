# 003- AutoCoder uses the Web version of the large model, the sexy Human As Model mode

Earlier we mentioned, how to solve the situation where you don't have the API version of the large model, or your API version of the large model is too weak, and you only have the Web version such as Kimi/GPT4, how can AutoCoder help you with programming?

We have two ways, the first one is to remove the `execute/auto_merge` parameters. At this point, you can find your prompt in the `target_file` and drag it into the Web version. The generated code, you can basically just copy and paste it.

However, you may want AutoCoder to handle steps like automatic merging, how can you do that? Here we have a new parameter called `human_as_model`. Let's see how to use it:

```yml
source_dir: /tmp/t-py
target_file: /home/winubuntu/projects/ByzerRawCopilot/output.txt 

model: qianwen_chat
model_max_length: 2000
model_max_input_length: 6000
anti_quota_limit: 5

search_engine: bing
search_engine_token: ENV {{BING_SEARCH_TOKEN}}

## execute the prompt generated by auto-coder
execute: true
## extract the code from the prompt generated by auto-coder 
## and overwrite the source code
auto_merge: true

project_type: py

human_as_model: true

query: >
  Add a new method before the read_root method,
  corresponding rest path is /hello, 
  output return value is "world"  
```

Here, compared to before, there is an additional `human_as_model` parameter, which we set to true. Now we want to add a new HTTP interface. Let's execute our requirement:

```shell
auto-coder --file ./examples/from-zero-to-hero/003_human_as_model.yml
```

At this point, the terminal will automatically enter interactive mode:

It prompts you that it has saved the question to the output.txt file, you answer this question. At this point, I paste the question to Claude:

![](../images/image6.png)

Calude generated the following code:

![](../images/image7.png)

Now we copy it, make sure to copy the entire reply, not just the code, it should look like this after copying:

![](../images/image8.png)

End with EOF to indicate you have finished pasting, then press Enter.

At this point, when you open the server.py file, the content has been updated:

![](../images/image9.png)

We have added a new interface.

As your project progresses, the model's generation ability will also become stronger, because there are more new things, which can directly help you generate business code.

## How to deal with multiple file modifications

Because the length of the generated large model is usually limited, and far less than the input (especially in the web version). At this point, you can enable the following parameter:

```yaml
enable_multi_round_generate: true
```

At this point,

1. When you paste the prompt into the web version, only the code of one file will be generated. You paste the generated code into auto-coder, and then end with a new line EOF.
2. At this point, AutoCoder will not end, it will continue to give you a new prompt to paste.
3. This cycle continues until your requirement is complete.
4. Sometimes the large model does not say "\_\_completed\_\_" at the right time, you can manually enter "\_\_completed\_\_" or "\_\_EOF\_\_" to end this cycle, and finally add a new line and EOF to end.

## Summary

We can also see that each requirement is not too large, otherwise it will lead to uncontrollable results. The future development code will follow this process:

![](../images/image10.png)

Each requirement is a piece of text, understandable to everyone. How many changes have been made, what each change is, is basically textualized, which is a great benefit for product or development.

At the same time, combined with Git's version management, ensure the security of AutoCoder, through Test test set, ensure the correctness of AutoCoder.Next time, we will introduce how to integrate documentation and search engines, allowing AutoCoder to read the code you have written, refer to documentation, and conduct searches to complete the final code writing requirements.
